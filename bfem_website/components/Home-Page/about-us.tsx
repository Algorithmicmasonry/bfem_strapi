          BIBLE FAITH EVANGELICAL MINISTRIES (BFEM)

        is an interdenominational Ministry founded by{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">Pastor Tolulope Olanusi</span> in 2004.
        He received the divine call to begin the Ministry while he was still
        working with one of the largest banks in Nigeria. The decision to choose
        between his banking career and God&apos;s service was not an easy one
        for him. But according to the man of God, in the midst of his internal
        struggle, he was &quot;sure and certain that God never goes wrong and
        never misleads&quot;. So in obedience,
        <span className="font-semibold ml"> Pastor Tolulope Olanusi</span> started
        the ministry in 2004 in a rented hall with some youths in Akure, the
        capital of Ondo State, Nigeria. He borrowed money to pay for the rent as
        he was in a bad situation financially. He later retired voluntarily from
        the bank in 2008 to make his obedience to God total. Today the church
        has spread to some towns and villages in Nigeria. The church also has
        committed members across the globe who are devoted to the vision of the
        ministry.
